## 🍽 Physical Condition and Context on This Day

- Adrenal fatigue: Stage 2, gradually recovering  
- Candida cleansing: Week 3 (continuing antibiotics + antifungal herbs)  
- Wheat, dairy, and sugar: Usually avoided  
- Fat metabolism: Showing signs of recovery  
- Out since morning, slightly hungry at lunchtime  
- Supplements: Vitamin C, magnesium, zinc (high-absorption type), among others

## 🥢 What I Ate and the Meal Components

- **Main Dish**: Stir-fried white fish with onion, shiitake mushrooms, and snap peas (medicinal Chinese style)  
- **Side Dish**: Spicy cucumber and peanut salad  
- **Pickles**: Zha cai (Sichuan preserved mustard stem)  
- **Staple**: Chinese rice porridge (congee)  
- **Drink**: Jasmine tea (served in a pot)  
- **Dessert**: Avoided

## 🩺 Post-Meal Reactions and Physical Sensations

- **Symptom Onset**: Mild bloating shortly after the meal (naturally subsided within 5 minutes)  
- **Additional Care**: None (resolved on its own)  
- **Other Discomforts**: None (no notable drowsiness or gut reaction)

## 🧪 Analysis and Considerations

- **Primary Suspect**: Gastric irritation from zinc supplement (due to high absorption efficiency even post-meal, causing localized reaction)  
- **Contributing Factors**: Searing method, wheat flour (possibly not potato starch), amount of absorbed oil  
- A transient gastric mucosal irritation likely occurred due to this combination  
- Suggests that even with the same cooking method, the trio of “fish × flour × oil” tends to impose a heavier load

## 🧠 Observations and Future Guidelines

- “Tolerated” does not mean “optimal”  
- Safe in current condition, but might have been a no-go in earlier stages  
- “Torch-style stir-fry” varies in fat content depending on the dish—requires monitoring  
- Next time, trying steamed or light stir-fried dishes (e.g., chicken and asparagus) would be a good strategy

## ✅ Today’s Takeaway

> Q. Which combination is likely to cause mild stomach discomfort?  
> A. Highly absorbable zinc × oil-laden wheat-based dishes (especially on an empty stomach)
